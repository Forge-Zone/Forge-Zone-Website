This is like a 10-minute read.
Usually, I think being concise is far superior — but, in this case, I let myself just write and tell our story in a really raw way.

So, if you want to dig into stuff like what we're gonna do what we're gonna do, and what's next then read on.

else. **TLDR**:

- vision to have a place where anyone can have a place to build
- education space is a mess
- rn we're focused on growing and providing value
- we're pre revenue and trying to make rev. through sponsorships and job boards
- trying to market through instagram, yt
- we're not trying to be buildspace, we're trying to be forge zone
- my dream

if you don't know me I am [shrit](https://www.shrit.in/). founder of forge zone, if you don't know about forge zone then we're helping developers GTFOL (Get the f\*k of localhost) but why?

I've been into coding since I was [12](https://www.shrit.in/past).
Back then, I wasn't chasing money or anything.
I was just genuinely curious—wanted to build stuff, learn how things work.
So I started making projects. That's all it was. Just building.

but ppl around me were happy not because i'll be able to provide more value to world but just because CSE is in demand and having as many projects as possible in github profile as it will look good on CV  
I can't say they are wrong or they didn't care about me

at that point I convinced myself I am building random things learning diffrent things making myself more skillled not because i'll have a good resume but just soley I was having too much fun in building.

When I was 16, I had picked up a lot. And then I started feeling like the world should know I existed.
Honestly, I didn't do anything big. I used to contribute to open source communities and somehow find my way into random WhatsApp web dev groups. Believe it or not, just with these two things, I got freelance work.
And I kept going. For the next two years, I earned in six figures.
I started freelancing, and that's when I realised that making money from the internet was actually a thing. From there, there was no stopping. I kept exploring, tried reaching out to overseas agencies, and somehow, it all worked out.

It was just cool to realise there are so many ways to make money outside the traditional path.

in this whole point I realised there's no place for me

> **Modern-day education is stuck in the rat race of degrees and certificates. What if there was a place where people simply worked on shit they were passionate about. I want to prove that if you simply work on things you love, you'll find greater success and enjoyment.**

otherwise it's just lonely
Back then, there was this thing called [**buildspace**](http://buildspace.so/).

It was a platform where anyone could just start building their ideas in six weeks.
More than the ideas, what really stuck with me was how they approached the education space.
No BS pricing, no fluff—just actual value.
In six weeks, they gave more than what most Udemy courses try to sell.

I built _clientbase_ in **s5** and was honestly hyped for whatever new thing they were going to drop next.

Then they shut the whole thing down. Just like that.

anyhow after seeing them I started looking edtech in other way, not all edtechs are boring and only looking for money from investors and users, the feeling I had after watching farza and his buildspace team was **yo I wanna be like these ppl, I wanna have this much fun**, and honestly this is what I am gonna try doing it in forge zone

So where are we right now?
**_We're at complete zero._**
Are we gonna pull up, speedrun this whole thing, and be #1?
**_Lmao, no. Probably not._**
But I'm gonna learn more about this game, help actual people?
**_Fuck Yeah_**

so shrit everything's cool and all but forge zone is **free** how are you actually earning money
in the start we're not but with more and more users joining us revenue will grow exponentially,

something like this, but this is an ideal condition, from what I have learned in life nothing is ideal,
anything can go wrong it can go something like

lol honestly money if ofcourse a good motivating and measuring factor if we're doing well or not but honestly I just don't care, if I ever get funding I might give away 50% of the money to ppl to build more crazy shit

what my plans are till now to make money is,

1. **Sponsorships**: with more users joining in the dev tools market is going crazy with AI/ML, I think if we're able to get crazy amounts of connection this can be a ideal deal
2. **Job Boards** something similar like Angellist

we're brainstroming new ways to make money but yes this is it
also I see so many new founders building crazy products but are just doing so that they can get some funding and have a comfortable runaway

nah I ain't like that I would rather sleep on footpath everyday while building instead of worrying to get investors for my runaway then live a lavish live of the funding
I wanna actually build something which is valuable to ppl, and once I know it's valuable I am going to see if we really need funding or not

btw we are also trying to grow our discord so do [join our discord server](https://discord.gg/e3RfmAVAXV)

now shrit what about getting actual users in your platform?
as I said I wanna work from ground up whatever I said, is a cummalative data of talking many ppl but I still feel like data is still very less, right now I need more proof that what we're doing with small builds actually something which ppl want![https://i.postimg.cc/PxmRH6fq/3.png](https://i.postimg.cc/PxmRH6fq/3.png)
I am trying to connect with more ppl who knows to code and are in college dm me if you're one of them, hit me up

I am so happy that finding early users as student is very easy and everyone are looking to actually try new shit (crazy stuff)

but apart from it, I am bullish on going full organic until I find pmf, if you don't know what pmf is... in simple words it's just you verfying that your idea actually works, (usually do when your problem and solutions hits spot on), 95% startups fail here because they never found pmf

i am just trying to get user know what forge zone is through YT and insta rn

awesomee
now i know it'll be very small ppl but if they see then my art style is very similar to buildspace, it's not just I am straight up trying to copy them but I am trying to reproduce that effect, buildspace is too big for us to kill, but we're trying to have that same effect of buildership, and I really think ppl in India really need to get in these things

we're trying to be forge zone, and founder is simiply too obsessed with buildspace to let it go

well if you're tryin to talk about the founder then I would just like to end my note with telling what my dream is

> **A home for the ones who build—apps, beats, dreams.** > **Not just tech, but anything true.** > **Come if you create. Stay if you care\***

that'll be so cool, but rn I don't even have enough capital to rent a house, we have a long way to go, don't worry I am on it, we'll do it
